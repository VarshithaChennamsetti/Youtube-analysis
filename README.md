# Youtube-analysis
The sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis of a trending list on youtube.
The resource used by me for reference is:
https://github.com/ammar1y/YouTube-Trending-Videos-Analysis-2019/blob/master/YT-trending-analysis-2019-US.ipynb

The dataset used in the project are:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

The project uses python modules:
plotly
seaborn
matplotlib
sklearn
pandas 
numpy

It also shows a comparative analysis between Kmeans and HAC using the metrics Silhouette Coefficient and Calinski and Harabasz score.

There might be an error in loading the plotly images. The html file is added as a backup if the .ipynb file is not working. But it is a huge file of 4.2MB and hence github maynot allow it to be shown. But feel free to clone the repository!
